# Flight Ticket Price Predictor

![Flight Predictor Logo](flightimg.jpg)

This repository contains an end-to-end Machine Learning project for predicting flight ticket prices using the XGBoost algorithm and a Streamlit-based web interface. The project leverages historical flight data to forecast approximate ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source and destination cities, departure/arrival times, stops, class, duration, and days left before departure.
The model is trained on a dataset typically sourced from platforms like Kaggle (e.g., flight price prediction datasets), involving extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
